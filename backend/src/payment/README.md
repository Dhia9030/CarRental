## Payment Flow

### 1. Booking Creation

When a user creates a booking:

- Booking is created with `status: 'Pending'`
- Payment breakdown is calculated
- No payment is processed yet

### 2. Payment Processing

When user provides payment method:

```javascript
// Frontend: Get payment breakdown
const breakdown = await fetch("/payment-integration/breakdown/1");

// Frontend: Process payment
const result = await fetch("/payment-integration/process-full-payment", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    bookingId: 1,
    paymentMethodId: "pm_1234567890",
  }),
});

// Frontend: Confirm payment with Stripe
const { clientSecret } = result;
const confirmResult = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(clientSecret);

// Backend: Confirm payment
await fetch(`/payments/confirm/${confirmResult.paymentIntent.id}`, {
  method: "POST",
});
```

### 3. Payment Confirmation

- Payment is confirmed with Stripe
- Booking status changes to `'Confirmed'`
- Payment records are updated
- Transaction history is created

### 4. Booking Completion

- At rental end, complete the booking
- Handle damage assessment
- Release security deposit (minus damages)
- Process additional charges if needed

### 5. Cancellation Handling

- Calculate cancellation fees based on policy
- Process refunds minus fees
- Update booking status

## Cancellation Policy

The system implements a tiered cancellation policy:

- **Same day**: 100% cancellation fee
- **1-3 days before**: 50% cancellation fee
- **3-7 days before**: 25% cancellation fee
- **7+ days before**: 10% cancellation fee

Security deposits are always fully refunded for cancellations.

## Security Features
